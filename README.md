# Quant Finance Practices
These are several projects I have done in quantitative finance area. The projects either come from NYU math finance program study, or provided by friends in the industry. 

For most of the current projects, the goal is to practise and understanding well known theory or methodology, rather than looking for "alpha". The workload and nature of the projects are close to or have higher requirements than course projects at graduate level courses. 

Primary language is Python, at least for now. 

List of projects:

1. High frequency data analysis exercise 1
2. Multifactor model for daily stock returns
